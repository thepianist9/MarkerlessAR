# MarkerlessAr
<strong>A simple solution to incorporate object localization into conventional computer vision object detection algorithms. </strong>

<strong>IDEA: </strong> There aren't that many open source real-time 3D object detection. This is an example of using "more popular" 2D object detection and then localize it with a few feature points. It uses recently released [Barracuda](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.0/manual/index.html) for object detection and ARFoundation for AR. It works both on iOS and Android devices.

Currently supports tiny Yolo2 and 3 and 4.
